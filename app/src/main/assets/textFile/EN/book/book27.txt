C is a general-purpose compiled statically typed programming language developed in 1969-1973 by Bell Labs employee Dennis Ritchie as an evolution of the B language. It was originally designed to implement the UNIX operating system, but has since been ported to many other platforms. According to the design of the language, its constructs closely correlate with typical machine instructions, thanks to which it found application in projects for which the assembly language was characteristic, including both in operating systems and in various application software for a variety of devices - from supercomputers to embedded systems. The C programming language has had a significant impact on the development of the software industry, and its syntax has become the basis for programming languages such as C++, C#, Java, and Objective-C.
