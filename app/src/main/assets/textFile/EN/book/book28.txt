Ruby is a dynamic, reflective, interpreted high-level programming language. The language has an OS-independent multithreading implementation, strong dynamic typing, a garbage collector, and many other features. In terms of syntax, it is close to the Perl and Eiffel languages, and in its object-oriented approach, to Smalltalk. Also, some features of the language are taken from Python, Lisp, Dylan and Clu.
