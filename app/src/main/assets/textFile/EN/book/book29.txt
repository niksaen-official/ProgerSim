Windows Forms is an application programming interface (API) that provides a graphical user interface and is part of the Microsoft .NET Framework. This interface simplifies access to the elements of the Microsoft Windows interface by wrapping the existing Win32 API in managed code. Moreover, managed code - the classes that implement the API for Windows Forms do not depend on the development language. That is, a programmer can use Windows Forms in the same way as when writing software in C#, C++.
